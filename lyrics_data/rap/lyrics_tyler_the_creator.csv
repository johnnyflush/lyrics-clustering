"Its Been A Week Since The Carnival, Which I Have Now Realized Was The Greatest Day Of My Life. Seeing Everyone I Care About There Was Crazy. No, Thats Not Even The Part That Got Me Excited. Seeing What Some Stupid Little ideas Can Turn Into Is What Shocks Me. The Little Stupid Cats And Graphics I Made On Photo Shop Out Of Boredom On Flags And Murals; Seeing That Donut I Drew When I Was 15 On Stages And Everyones Bag; 10 Thousand People Came To A Place Called ‘Camp Flog Gnaw’, Wow\n\nI Remember When I Came Up With That Name Summer 2011. I Never Been To Camp And In My Head, I Created A Place That I Figured Would Never Exist, But That Changed. Just Fliping The First Letters Of Wolf Gang Turned Into Its Own Separate Thing. Seeing All Different Races From Skinny To Fat To Everything All In One Place With Something In Common Was Mind Blowing. The Zipper Is My Favorite Ride In The World. Not That You Care, But That Fact That I Figured Out How To Get That Thing And Ride It For As Many Times As I Want Without Waiting In Line IS Fucking Amazing\n\nI Have An Amazing Team With Me. No Matter How Crazy And Offensive Or Weird My Ideas Were, They Put Their Trust In Me And Allowed Me To Move Forward.Like Dude, We Threw A Fucking Carnival In The Middle Of Los Angeles With 10k Plus People. We Didn't Have Any Crazy Sponsors And I Didn't Have To Suck Up to Anyone Or Any Of That Shit, WE Did It. And The Skatepark? Did You See That Skatepark? I Was Up Till 2 Am Painting That Bitch! Growing Up In Hawthorne At The Dirty ( skatepark) And Seeing My Old Friends From There Getting Clips Was Prolly The Craziest Shit Ive Seen. How Far Ive Came With Every Little Idea that I Believed In No Matter Who Did Or Didn't. Walking Around Seeing Kids In EXACT Things That I Wear Is Mind Blowing. Something That I Just Naturally Like And Put On, Its Some Kid Out There That Studies Every Article Of Clothing That Was Put On And Emulates That. Thats Crazy To Me. I Used To Do That With P, So Know That Someone IS Looking At Me The Way I Look At Him Is Really Amazing To Me\n\nI Didn't Think I Would Change So Many Lives. Someone Retweeted An Old Tweet Of Mine From Feb 2012 Yesterday And It Read ’ I Had A Dream That Kanye Invited Me To Perform LATE With Him. I Wish’. Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I’m Just Blabbing Now. I Just Want Who Ever Reading This To Know That Anything Is Possible, No Matter How Crazy It May Seem, Anything IS Possible You Just Have To Figure It Out. Get Your Self Esteem Up And Like Yourself, Then Like Your Ideas. We Live In A World Where People Dont Even Like Their Own Ideas, That Why You Have People Copying One Thing Thats Working So Much, Then Everything Gets Over Saturated With The Same Shit, And That Goes With Fashion, Music And All That. If People Actually Loved Themselves And Believed In Themselves More You Know How Many More Crazy Things Would Be Created? There Is No Fucking Limit To Anything! ( Except Elevators)\n\nIts A World Of People Who Dont Give A Fuck About The Mall Or The Radio Or None Of That Shit, Who Dont Care About Race Or If Someone Is Gay Or What Not. Thats What I Was Trying To Say On That Arsenio Interview. I Prolly Came Of As An Idiot Tho. Im Really Passionate About Everything I Do. From Music To Clothing To Videos. I Love Make Videos So Much. I Just Want Some Millionaire To Throw Me Money To Be Creative And Get Shots. I Remember Kids In School Always Thought I Was Weird, Not Just Cause How I Dressed Or The Music I Liked Or That Fact I Was Just Different Overall( in comparison to them), But Because I Was So Open With Future Goals. I Would Always Say The Grammies Im Gonna Get, And The Number 1 Movie Im Going To Write And Direct, And Just Random Shit Im Gonna Do. Now Those Same Dude Who Shut Me Down Are Paying Shitty College Debt Doing Something They Hate, Because They Didn't Go Full Throttle On Their Own Dreams And Quickly Shitted On Mines. And Im Not Knocking Anyone In College, Please Get Your Education, Im Just Saying, Do What You Love And Be Happy, Dont Live For Anyone Else. I Dont Like The Color Black. I Dont Know What That Has To Do With Anything But I Like Colors, Bright Colors, Like Flowers. It Brings A Great Energy\n\nOk Im Just Talking Again. Its Prolly A lot Of Typos In This But Im Just Going Off Of What Ever Is Coming To My Head. This Photo Of Na-Kel Smith Skating In Front Of The GOLF Mural At The Skatepark Means So Much To Me.

The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps.\n\nIt crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again.  Tyler brings his hand up and looks down on the cockroach, and we see the word ""Kill"" written in sharpie on the back of his hand. We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle.\n\nThe cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera.\n\nTyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera.

He becomes completely out of view at one point, then when he comes back into view, his nose begins to bleed.

Officer Perez and O'Farrell stated to Det Lyons that they arrived on the scene with the Pace team and observed a large crowd. Officers stated the establishment was at capacity with 999 people inside. Officers stated to Det Lyons that the employees who were assigned to work the door for the Scoot Inn were allowing 1 person inside as 1 person exited the establishment. At this time, Officer Perez and O'Farrell walked inside of the establishment to check the area and observed the performer ""TYLER THE CREATOR"" onstage. The officers stated to Det Lyons that at that moment ""TYLER THE CREATOR"" yelled out to the large crowd of people waiting in line outside the building ""ALL YALL OUTSIDE THE GATES YALL PUSH THROUGH."" At that time, Officers Perez and O'Farrell stated the crowd waiting in line outside started to try and push the employees working the door out of the way, but hesitated. The officers also stated the employees working the door then immediately attempted to secure the doors and close them and that is when ""TYLER THE CREATOR"" yelled out again to the large crowd who were now becoming unruly and enraged ""YALL PUSH THROUGH GET IN COME ON."" At this time, the Officers stated they observed the large crowd push through the employees working the door which created an immediate danger of injury to persons. Officers then stated the performer ""TYLER THE CREATOR"" began apologizing then cursing at employees working the door before he exited the stage. Officers stated after the ""riot"" dispersed, they made contact with a bartender who is an employee of the Scoot Inn and he was identified as: Mylan, Thomas. Officers stated Thomas made a statement to them that during the ""Riot"" he held several people back so one girl who fell to the ground would not get trampled. Officers stated Thomas then told them that while he was trying to protect the girls who fell he was punched by an unknown male subject to the left side of his face which caused him pain. Officers stated they could not locate the suspect due to the large amount of people at the establishment. Officer Perez and O'Farrell stated they called for more officers to respond to the scene and that is when the crowd dispersed\n\nIn Sec 42.02 of the Penal ""Riot"" is listed as a Class B Misdemeanor. (F) an offense under this section is an offense of the same classification as any offense of a higher grade committed by anyone engaged in the riot of the offense was: (1) in furtherance of the purpose of the  assembly. In this caste the bartender: Mylan, Thomas who is an employee of the Scoot Inn was punched to the left side of his face which caused him pain. This constitutes an Assault W/Injury a Class A Misdemeanor offense. This enhances the Class B Classification of ""Riot"" to the higher grade Class A Misdemeanor.

"All of you negative motherfuckers should look to me as inspiration. I'm 23 fucking years old and I built a fucking monster and I'm not ever gonna fucking land. Stop being scared and negative. Start believing in yourself and stop living for all these other fucking idiots. Some of y'all should put that fucking blunt down and go do what the fuck you know you need to do. Do it for yourself. I believe in everyone because I believe in myself. Fuck reaching for the stars, that's setting a limit. Fuck those. Some of you don't like yourself. Some of you aren't comfortable with yourself. That's so fucking sad. Stop that shit. Some of you can't. That's why y'all ask for likes on Instagram and shit, because y'all's self esteem is so fucking low. Cut that shit out and start liking yourself. When that happens, you will start trusting yourself, then you trust your ideas, then you fucking become that person you really want to be. If you don't have any confidence, let me be your fucking confidence\n\nI'm gonna be a fucking great years from now and I fully believe that and fully do not care about anyone's opinion on why I'm not because I know. Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10. I knew the music, I loved the colors, and I knew what I was into. Most of you listen to what ever is hot or what your friends like, y'all dress how everyone else dresses, y'all do what everyone else does. FUCKING STOP BEING A FUCKING FOLLOWER. Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like ""easier said than done"" or ""you are a hypocrite"" or ""you changed"" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED\n\nI don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music (I've been playing CC The World for like 6 hours) and I just realized, ""Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha.

"I was 15 attending summer school at Hawthorne High, spending most of my nights trying to find any snippets of the album on various German sites. Then 7/25/06 came. IMM ranges in different styles and sounds and I believe that's why I gravitated to it so much. The upright bassline on “Can I Have It Like That” or the buckets on “How Does It Feel”. Off the wall MJ on “Number 1<U+2033>. I still to this day don't think I can make a song better than “That Girl”. And “I Really Like You Girl” is easily the best song on this album with your best Timberlake impersonation and Stevie harmonica. IMM also includes “Raspy Shit” which is the worst song in your discography I hate that song so much you are so gross for that. But the one that stood out was “You Can Do It Too”. The sade bassline, the string pad with chords that you claim only Q-Tip, you and I like, the Jamie Cullum outro!\n\nBeing 15 black not really “interested” in what the majority of my peers were into, it made me feel safe. I was optimistic, always daydreaming and setting goals so I felt you were directly speaking to me. I remember clancy telling me how Jimmy Iovine thought this album was a “complete fucking failure it didnt work”. But see, it did, just not on the kids he was looking at. The ones who just existed; used the popular slang; listened to what was thrown at them; dressed in clothing that was trending at the time. Not saying that's bad but of course this wouldn't work on them. But it worked on me and I created Odd Future that same summer. I was actually naive enough to believe you and thought I could do all these amazing things if I really tried.\n\nWhere I grew up, niggas get stuck and never make it out. Jail, dead, shit jobs, not really growing. It seems like at a certain age, ideas; original thoughts are no longer a thing; I didnt fall into that cycle. I’m now a young entrepreneur all because I believed you when you said I could be. You were the first person I contacted when I pulled off that McLaren dealership!\n\nThis is getting long so uhhh, hbd IMM. I never had brothers, uncles or my father around so thank you for being the male figure I gravitated to. Allowing me to embrace being different and trusting my ideas.",2826839,In My Mind 10 Years Anniversary Letter,685,"Tyler, The Creator"
