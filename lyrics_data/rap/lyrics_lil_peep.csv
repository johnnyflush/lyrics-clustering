I think that life is beautiful\n\n[Verse 2]\nWake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible\nFind out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical\nWhen I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable\nIsn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible\nYou think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable\nYou think you can do it, but your chances are improbable\nOnce you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle\nIsn't life comical? I think that life is comical\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd if you ever need a friend then you got me\nAnd in the end, when I die, would you watch me?\nAnd if I try suicide, would you stop me?\nWould you help me get a grip or would you drop me?\nRun away, make friends with the moon\nWhy you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon\nThere comes a time when everybody meets the same fate\nI think I'ma die alone inside my room\n\n[Outro]\nIsn't life beautiful?
