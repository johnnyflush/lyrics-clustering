"Where will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?\n\nBefore I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive\n\nThere are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently\n\nIn recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it\n\nMusic is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art\n\nArrows Through the Heart\n\nIn mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us\n\nThere are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to). Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past\n\nHowever, some artists will be like finding ""the one."" We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon\n\nI think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say ""shock""; I said ""surprise."" I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?\n\nIn the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be\n\nThere are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento ""kids these days"" want is a selfie. It's part of the new currency, which seems to be ""how many followers you have on Instagram.""\n\nFan Power\n\nA friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around\n\nAnother theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool\n\nThis moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all\n\nCelebrity Spotlight\n\nI predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, ""It was never this crazy for us back then!"" And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to\n\nAnd as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism\n\nAnd I'd also like a nice garden","472578","The Future of Music Is a Love Story","1177","Taylor Swift"

"Taylor's Letter\nThis album is called ""Fearless"", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them. I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you're NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless\n\n\n1.

"""These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours.""\n\nI was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.\n\nIn the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...\n\nThe debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?\n\nFor the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before.\n\nI wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no ""riding off into the sunset,"" like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off.\n\nI've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.\n\nI hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.\n\nFrom the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...\n\nLove, Taylor","2292967","1989 [Liner Notes]","1177","Taylor Swift"

"Search\n\nWhere is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.","2822647","Taylor Swift Responds To Kanye's 'Famous' Lyric","1177","Taylor Swift"

"Here's something I've learned about people.\n\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\n\nThis is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\n\nThe point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.\n\nWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?\n\nLet me say it again, louder for those in the back...\n\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.\n\nThere will be no further explanation.\nThere will be just reputation.","3310416","Reputation [Prologue]","1177","Taylor Swift"

"I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.\n\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.\n\nSo many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info.

"This is another way I've written songs recently. This is  a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds."" And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with is, send it to me"". And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that"". So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:\n\nOkay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this\n\nIt's 2 am, in your car\nWindows down, past my street the memories start\nIt's in the past\nYou drive straight ahead\nYou thinking that I hate you now\nCause you still don't know what I never said\n\nI wish you would come back\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did\nI wish you knew that\n\nDo you like it!?","552952","I Wish You Would (Voice Memo)","1177","Taylor Swift"
"So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing. So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together\n\nI sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else"". So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places"". So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song\n\n""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:\n\nUh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i\n\nNa na na na waiting at the back door\nThey're around and the vultures come around\nAnd you know that they won't, they won't us\nSay what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us\nAnd you come and sing and listen\nI would not think about it but I'm not done\nEvery know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I\n\nCause they got the cages, they got the boxes\nAnd guns\nThey are the hunters we are the foxes\nAnd we run\n\nBaby, I know places we won't be found\nAnd they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down\nCause I, I know places we can hide\nI know places, I know places\n\nUh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, no places\n\nOr whatever I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark, lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus.

"I'm curled up in my mother's bed, staring intently at my laptop. I'm watching a video of a familiar-looking man wearing a black tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear:\n\n""Now I'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda's metal in this song I wish I'd wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee.""\n\nThe camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and she's looking down at a framed picture. She's at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. That's when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is ""Someone Loves You Honey."" The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee.\n\nBrenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.\n\nI watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. There's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it's almost like she's golden.","3284327","Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute)","1177","Taylor Swift"

And what what did you think the first time you heard it?\nOr how was the first time?\nTim:\nIt was awesome. Uh except for I didn't know if I should I should take it\nAs a compliment or I should feel old\nDJ:\nA ha ha ha\nTim:\nI didn't know which one but the more\nThe more I hear it the more...I don't know if its true or not\nBut I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old\nI don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think\nDJ:\nWhy don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?\nTaylor:\nOh its definitely a compliment. Yeah\n(Laughing)\nDJ:\nTim McGraw meet Taylor Swift\nTim:\nNice-\nTaylor:\nNice to meet you\nTim:\nNice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?\nTaylor:\nI'm doing great. How are you doing?\nTim:\nI'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great\nTaylor:\nThank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good\nMusic and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker\n(laughing)\nDJ:\nWell-\nTaylor:\nThe funny thing about this song is ya know\nAs a writer some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll\nDo them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but\nI wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really\nDidn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so\nI kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it\nWas going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like\nWe're putting that out\n(laughing)\nTim:\nWell I'm glad ya did cuz um it's doing well for ya\nDJ:\nSo I-\nSo I understand that you two guys have not talked\nTim:\nNo\nDJ:\nYou haven't met\nTim:\nNo\nTaylor:\nNo, we've never talked or met or anything\nTim:\nI sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly\nOr something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was\nI was doing an interview and they were going to interview\nTaylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message\nSo, I don't know if she got it or not\nTaylor:\nOh my God. They never gave that to me\nTim:\nThey didn't? Ok well, there ya go. I did\n(laughing)\nDJ:\nSo I-I\nTaylor:\nWe've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything\nTim:\nNot at all\nDJ:\nSo I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called\nTim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?\nTaylor:\nIt was definitely kind of a chance\nYa know I did say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking\nYa know, he wouldn't take it too bad\nTim:\nWell, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad\nI'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-\nTaylor:\nCould you tell Faith that I said hello?\nTim:\nI sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way\nTaylor:\nOh my gosh, she's awesome\nTim:\nI agree\nDJ:\nThis, this...Tell me about writing a song\nUm did this, did this really happen?\nTaylor:\nWell, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing\nSession on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw\nUm, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nI actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the\nMelody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year\nOf high school\nTim:\nNow I feel old\nTaylor:\nAnd um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself\nAnd I was going through a period where I was dating this guy\nThat was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up\nSo I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind\nHim of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya\nKnow that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are\nTim:\nAww, thank you\nTaylor:\nAnd uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first\nAnd so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano\nAnd wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering\nIf I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know\nThe funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and\nNever never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it\nAnd uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it\nFor my record label president and he goes ""well thats your first single""\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nAnd I'm like well\nTim:\nWell you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nThats awesome. There's a part two coming out next month\nTim:\nAlright, great\n(laughing)\nTim:\nWell congratulations cuz its your first single\nFirst top ten hit and thats pretty exciting\nAnd I know you're off to the races here\nYou're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you\nTaylor:\nAwesome, its been so exciting\nTim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?\nTim:\nUm I dont know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that\n(laughing)\nTaylor:\nWell I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it\nTim:\nYa do? What would-\nTaylor:\nYeah\nTim:\nWhat would their name be?\nTaylor:\nUh, um I think Taylor something\nTim:\nSomething like that yeah\nTaylor:\nBut\nTim:\nWell I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me\nTaylor:\nJust consider it\nDJ:\nAh, well thats very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift\nI'll tell ya that\nTim:\nRight she's, she's gonna be forward this time\nDJ:\nI think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well\nTim:\nAbsolutely\nDJ:\nHey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us\nTaylor:\nIt was awesome and thank you.

"I write this to explain why I’ll be holding back my album, 1989, from the new streaming service, Apple Music. I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries.\n\nI’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.\n\nThis is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.\n\nThese are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.\n\nI realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.\n\nThree months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.\n\nBut I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\n\nTaylor","2146412","To Apple, Love Taylor","1177","Taylor Swift"

"I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.\nSo many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info.
