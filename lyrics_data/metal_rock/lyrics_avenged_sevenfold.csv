Shadows]\nOur truth is painted across the sky\nIn our reflection we learn to fly\nNo hand to hold us\nNo one to save us from tomorrow\n\nSailing away, beyond the reach of anyone\nFar beyond the dreams of everyone\nNo light to follow\nA shot in the dark\nDoes anybody know?\nSailing away, beyond the reach of anyone\nFar beyond the dreams of everyone\nHigh from the heavens\nI can't see the pain\nDoes anybody care?\n\nThink for a moment of all the lives\nStripped of their essence before their time\nWe stand to conquer\nBut is there nothing left tomorrow?\n\nSailing away, beyond the reach of anyone\nFar beyond the dreams of everyone\nNo light to follow\nA shot in the dark\nDoes anybody know?\nSailing away, beyond the reach of anyone\nFar beyond the dreams of everyone\nHigh from the heavens\nI can't see the pain\nDoes anybody care?\n\n[Neil deGrasse Tyson]\n""We have one collective hope: the Earth; And yet, uncounted people remain hopeless. Famine and calamity abound\nSufferers hurl themselves into the arms of war. People kill and get killed in the name of someone else’s concept of God\n\nDo we admit that our thoughts and behaviors spring from a belief that the world revolves around us?\nEach fabricated conflict, self-murdering bomb, vanished airplane, every fictionalized dictator, biased or partisan, and wayward son are part of the curtains of society’s racial, ethnic, religious, national and cultural conflicts, and you find the human ego turning the knobs and pulling the levers\n\nWhen I track the orbits of asteroids, comets and planets, each one a pirouetting dancer in a cosmic ballet, choreographed by the forces of gravity, I see beyond the plight of humans. I see a Universe ever-expanding, with its galaxies embedded within the ever-stretching four-dimensional fabric of space and time\n\nHowever big our world is, our hearts, our minds, our outsize atlases, the universe is even bigger; There are more stars in the Universe than grains of sand on the world’s beaches. More stars in the Universe than seconds of time that have passed since Earth formed. More stars than words and sounds ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived\n\nThe day we cease the exploration of the cosmos is the day we threaten the continuing of our species\nIn that bleak world, arms-bearing, resource-hungry people and nations would be prone to act on their low-contracted prejudices, and would have seen the last gasp of human enlightenment\nUntil the rise of a visionary new culture that once again embraces the cosmic perspective: a perspective in which we are one, fitting neither above nor below... but within.""","2893921","Exist","20710","Avenged Sevenfold"
